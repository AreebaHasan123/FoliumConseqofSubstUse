# Folium Project Consequences of Substance Use
Data retrieved from The Indiana Prevention Resource Center (https://iprc.iu.edu/epidemiological-data/)

Using Folium, I created a map that show the number of unique School Suspensions( Includes in-school and out-of-school suspensions,) or Expulsions Related to Alcohol, Tobacco, and/or Drug Use in all the different counties of IN during the 2021-2022 School Year. 
Green represents less than 100 students.
Orange represents 100-200 students.
Red is any number of students above 200.
